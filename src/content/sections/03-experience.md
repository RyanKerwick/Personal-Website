  <h3>Treasurer — DKE (2024–2025)</h3>
  <ul class="collapsible-content collapsed">
    <li>As Treasurer, I am responsible for the financial health of our fraternity, managing semester budgets that range from $30K–$50K. I collect dues from 40 active members and oversee our bank account and debit card to ensure transparent and reliable financial operations.</li>
    <li>Beyond the numbers, I work closely with recruitment, social, philanthropy, and housing chairs to create balanced budgets that reflect the chapter’s priorities. This means not only tracking expenses but also facilitating discussions about tradeoffs, maximizing the value of every dollar spent, and making sure resources are allocated fairly across events and initiatives.</li>
    <li>This role has strengthened my skills in financial management, collaboration, and decision-making, while also giving me experience in communicating complex tradeoffs in a way that builds consensus among diverse groups.</li>
